## Summary
A graph is a data structure containing a set of vertices and a set of edges.<br>
Adding value to vertices the graph becomes **undirected and unweighted**.<br>
A graph becomes **directed** when it's edges get directions, e.g. if an edge connects vertices A and B,<br>
it can be directed in a way that you can only traverse from A to B, not from B to A.
Each edge can also have a number(that can also be negative) representing it's weight, thus making the graph a **directed weighted graph**.
